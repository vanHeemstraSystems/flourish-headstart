Data Visualization and Storytelling

## 100 - Introduction

Talkies in Flourish: see https://flourish.studio/blog/audio-talkie-visualisation-data-stories/

When we (flourish team) set out to build Flourish a few years ago, the idea was to make a visualization tool that allowed people to go beyond basic charts and maps and to create genuine narrative-driven stories, complete with animations between views and advanced visualizations and maps. Talkies were always part of the plan, but we couldn’t do everything at once, so in the first version of Flourish stories the only way to move between “slides” was using the next and back buttons. Animations: check. Rich visualization: getting there. Audio: one day!

Finally, as of today, you can add an audio file to any Flourish story to create a Talkie. Here’s how it works:

- Create a Flourish story with as many slides as you like

- Under “Audio/autoplay” choose “Enabled”

- Upload your voiceover as an MP3 file

- Set durations for each slide to line up the visuals with the audio

- Hit “Publish to share or embed”

Another option is to skip the audio upload step to make an “autoplay” story that silently progresses through the slides at specified times, optionally looping at the end. This can be handy, for example, when using a Flourish data story on a big screen at an event.
